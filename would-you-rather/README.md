# Would you Rather Project

Would You rather project is a game where the user chooses an option of what they would rather do. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, the user can ask a new question, answer an already asked question, view the poll results of an answered question, and see the ranking of the users on the leaderboard.

## Installation
